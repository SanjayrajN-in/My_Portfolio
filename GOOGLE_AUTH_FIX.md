# Google Authentication Fix Guide

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced MongoDB connection error handling
2. Improved Google OAuth error reporting
3. Added detailed environment variable validation
4. Created diagnostic test endpoints
5. Updated Vercel configuration for API routes
6. Fixed CORS headers for authentication requests
7. Added direct API endpoint for Google authentication
8. Updated client-side code to try multiple endpoints

## Testing Steps

After deploying these changes to Vercel, follow these steps to test and fix the Google authentication:

### 1. Test the Diagnostic Endpoints

Visit these endpoints to check your configuration:

- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/health` - Basic API health check
- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/env-test` - Environment variables test
- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/mongodb-test` - MongoDB connection test
- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/test-mongodb` - Direct MongoDB connection test
- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/test-google-auth` - Google OAuth credentials test

### 2. Check MongoDB Connection

The most likely issue is with your MongoDB connection. Make sure:

- Your MongoDB URI is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- The format is correct: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
- Your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- The database user has the correct permissions

### 3. Verify Google OAuth Configuration

Make sure your Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured:

- Check that GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are correctly set in Vercel
- Verify that the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches your OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL
- Make sure the Google Cloud Console project has the Google+ API enabled

### 4. Check Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth client secret
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token generation
- `OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`: Should be `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`

### 5. Test Google Login

After verifying all the above, try logging in with Google again.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If the MongoDB test endpoints return errors:

1. Check the MongoDB Atlas dashboard to ensure your cluster is running
2. Verify that your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
3. Check that the database user credentials are correct
4. Try creating a new database user and updating the connection string

### Google OAuth Issues

If the Google OAuth test endpoint returns errors:

1. Verify your Google Cloud Console project settings
2. Make sure the OAuth consent screen is configured correctly
3. Check that the authorized redirect URIs include your callback URL
4. Try regenerating the client secret and updating it in Vercel

### API Route Issues

If you're still getting 500 errors from the API routes:

1. Check the Vercel Function Logs for detailed error messages
2. Make sure all API files are properly deployed
3. Verify that the vercel.json file is correctly configured

### Try the Direct Endpoint

We've added a direct endpoint that doesn't rely on Vercel rewrites:

- `https://sanjayrajn.vercel.app/api/auth-google`

This endpoint should work even if there are issues with the Vercel rewrites configuration.
